I've just discovered google's awesome new [DNS domain service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Domains), [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/).  It's much easier to use and cheaper than the one I was using before and includes free private registration, domain forwarding and email forwarding.  I've thus also created a new email address [steve@notmandatory.org](mailto:steve@notmandatory.org) and corresponding new [gpg public key](/static/steve_notmandatory.asc).
